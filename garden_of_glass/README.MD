Garden of Glass
---

This subdirectory contains Garden of Glass, Botania's skyblock mode.

This is nothing more than a dressed-up datapack. It contains recipe and other overrides in its /data, but otherwise has no code at all.

The code side of GoG lives in Botania itself.

To build, simply run `make` in this directory to produce a jar file that can be dropped into `mods/`.
