**Garden of Glass** is a Botania addon that allows you to create a **Skyblock**-esque world.

Aside from this, certain items and blocks are added and recipes tweaked to fit Skyblock gameplay better.

This addon is designed so that every single item in the game can be acquired legitimately.

The jarfile required to play in this gamemode is a mod, but contains no code and behaves like a glorified datapack.

It contains some datapack additions to the base game, and tells the base Botania mod to enable other GoG features.

To generate a server world with Garden of Glass:

<!-- TODO there was also another earlier string, I think pre-1.16? Needs to be put here.-->
1. If on Forge and below 1.19, set `level-type` to `botania:gardenofglass` in server.properties.
2. If on Forge and at or above 1.19, set `level-type` to `gardenofglass:gardenofglass` instead.
3. On Fabric, modded level types are not supported by default, so you'll have to generate
   a GoG world in single player then upload it to the server.
